                        In May 2015 The Swim School started offering private, semi-private and group swim lessons in Manatee County for adults and children 12 months of age and older. In addition to providing quality stroke instruction for all ability levels, The Swim School also offers aquatics fitness classes, lifeguard services and CPR/First Aid services upon request. In March 2018, The Swim School expanded their services and founded the North River Rapids Swim Team, a seasonal program for youth ages 5-19.

                        Originally from Pennsylvania, Hilary started swimming at the age of five and continued competitively through college in Ohio where she earned a B.A. in Psychology. After receiving her degree in 2003, she returned to PA and worked part-time as a lifeguard, swim lesson instructor, and swim team coach in addition to having a full-time position in the human services field assisting children with special needs. With a love for the beach and a craving for a warmer climate, Hilary relocated to Florida in 2006 and worked as an Aquatics Director at a YMCA for over eight years where she developed a year round competitive swim team program, administered a progressive swim lesson program and conducted water fitness classes at two aquatics facilities. She is a certified AEA Aquatic Fitness Professional, YMCA Swim Lesson Instructor, YMCA Lifeguard, and ASHI CPR-PR/AED & First Aid Instructor.
