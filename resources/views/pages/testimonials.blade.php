                    "Ms. Hilary is Amazing!! When my son started swim lessons he had sensory issues and did not want to put his face under water or participate much. After only 2 four week sessions he is swimming on his own without a float at 4 years old and is willing to try everything. She is so patient and creative. I will definitely use her for my daughter as well."

                    The instructor is outstanding! I have a high functioning autistic child and hired The Swim School for private lessons, due the fact my child was terrified of water. She taught our child how to swim in 5 lessons! I can't give a higher recommendation~she is enthusiastic, creative and prompt! Thank you!

                    "I had 2 nervous, first-time swimmers, ages 1 and 3 and they both progressed a lot during the 8 days of lessons. Ms. Hillary focuses on constant encouragement and re-directing to a new activity instead of dwelling on what stresses them out. For example, my son was really nervous to float on his back (supported) for the first time, and Hillary just kept on encouraging him in new ways and varying the activity focus until he was doing it without even realizing it. Then she made him feel like a hero when he did it. She has a combination of warmth and professionalism that I just really enjoyed and appreciated as a parent. We will be repeat customers to say the least!"
