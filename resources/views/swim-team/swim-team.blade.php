In May 2015, Hilary took her passion for teaching aquatics programs and established The Swim School, offering private, semi-private and group swim lessons in Manatee County for adults and children 12 months of age and older. She is excited to have the opportunity to develop the North River Rapids Swim Team and is looking forward to the 2018 inaugural season.</p>
