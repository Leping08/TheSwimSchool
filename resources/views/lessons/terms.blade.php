                <dt>Facility Use:</dt>
                <dd>Facility use outside of swim instruction is for residents only.</dd>


                <dt>Payment:</dt>
                <dd>Payment must be made on the first day of a swim lesson session. {Something about online payment here!!!!!!!!}</dd>


                <dt>Schedule:</dt>
                <dd>Students may not be moved to a different class or time once classes are full. Additional classes may be scheduled due to demand. Class times are subject to change from session to session.</p>


                <dt>Equipment:</dt>
                <dd>Goggles are highly recommended for improved vision, comfort and performance. Please supply yourself or your child(ren) with a pair of goggles for swim lesson classes. Towels will not be supplied so please have a towel for yourself or your child(ren) as well. Long hair should be tied back with a hair tie. All other equipment will be supplied by The Swim School.</dd>


                <dt>Swim Level:</dt>
                <dd>The instructor reserves the right to change a student’s swim level and class in accordance with their swimming abilities as necessary throughout the duration of a swim lesson session.</p>


                <dt>Safety:</dt>
                <dd>All children 12 years of age and younger must be accompanied by an adult and directly supervised before and after their swim lesson classes. There are no lifeguards at the facility, so adults are encouraged to assist the instructor in monitoring their child(ren) throughout the swim lesson classes to ensure additional safety.</dd>


                <dt>Class Observation:</dt>
                <dd>In order to foster the best learning environment for each student enrolled in The Swim School programs, the least amount of distraction is equired. For students to remain focused and fully attentive to their instructor during swim lesson classes, parents and other family members are permitted on the pool deck but must view students from the designated observation area (except for the Parent & Toddler class). We know this may be difficult, but students respond better to the instructor when they are without direct parent or family member involvement. If a student does not participate right away, it’s OK. They will watch and learn. If there is a problem, the instructor will come to you.</dd>


                <dt>Inclement Weather:</dt>
                <dd>In the event of inclement weather (i.e. thunder/lightning, heavy rain, and/or air temperature of 65 degrees or below), swim lesson classes will be cancelled. The instructor will contact you when a class needs to be cancelled due to inclement weather and will notify you as to when a makeup class will be scheduled. It is best to assume swim lesson classes are on as scheduled if you are not contacted by the instructor.</dd>


                <dt>Makeup Classes:</dt>
                <dd>Makeup classes will only be scheduled for swim lesson classes cancelled by the instructor. Makeup classes for weekday sessions will take place on Fridays at their regularly scheduled class times. Makeup classes for Sunday sessions will take place on Sundays following the session at their regularly scheduled class times. Because of the progressive nature of The Swim School programs and limited class sizes, no special make up classes will be offered for lessons missed by participants due to holidays, vacation, illness, etc. However, it may be possible to accommodate a makeup class for a student if the same class is available on a different day/time that is not full.</dd>


                <dt>Parent & Toddler Class:</dt>
                <dd><u>This is NOT an infant survival course.</u> The purpose of The Swim School Parent & Toddler program is to provide children with a positive experience in the water. Children will learn basic water skills through songs and play to develop trust and confidence in the water.</dd>

                <ol>                
                    <li>
                        <p>In-water participation of a parent, guardian, or other trusted adult is required for all children attending a Parent & Toddler swim lesson class.</p>                </li>               <li>                <p>Students must wear swim diapers.</p>             </li>       <li>                 <p>Please remember all children learn at different rates. Don’t be upset if your child’s initial reaction to the water is to cry. It may take a few times for your child to become accustomed to the surroundings. Be patient with your child and praise him or her as they attempt new skills.</p>             </li>            <li>             <p>Submersions controlled by an adult will be practiced but limited. Voluntary face submersions and swallowing water by children under 24 months must be limited and monitored by parents and instructors.</p>       </li>
                </ol>



                <dt>Ens Of Session:</dt>
                <dd>At the conclusion of a swim lesson session, each student will receive a progress report and a certificate of participation. The instructor will indicate on the progress report which level the student should register for in the next session.</dd>
